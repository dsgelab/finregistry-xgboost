# finregistry-xgboost

Code for training xgboost models using the FinRegistry matrices as input. More detailed instructions coming.

## Installation

### ePouta and FinnGen sandbox

Probably the easiest way to install the required packages is to create a separate conda environment using the environment.yml file:

``conda env create --file environment.yml``

Then activate the environment

``conda activate fr_xgb``

Note that if you use this environment in ePouta or in FinnGen sandbox. You need to import it using conda-pack (which is included in the requirements.yml). So after activating the environment, you should run

``conda pack -n fr_xgb``

More instructions regarding conda-pack in ePouta can be found from the FinRegistry master document
